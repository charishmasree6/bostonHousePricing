Boston House Price Prediction
This project implements a Machine Learning model to predict house prices in the Boston area and deploys it as a Flask web application. The goal is to provide a simple interface where a user can input various socio-economic and environmental factors to get an estimated house price.

The core components are:

HousePricePrediction.ipynb: Data cleaning, EDA, model training, and evaluation.

regmodel.pkl: The saved, trained machine learning model.

scaling.pkl: The saved feature scaling object (e.g., StandardScaler), crucial for preprocessing new user input before prediction.

app.py: The Flask application logic that loads the model and handles web requests.

templates/home.html: The HTML frontend for user interaction.
